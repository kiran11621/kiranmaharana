Computer science has revolutionized and reshaped how our species has socially and economically developed over the past century. Despite an ever-widening field of computer science for the 21st-century student, I feel it is undoubtedly the most influential and concrete foundation of the society we live in today. 

I am being an Engineering Student Pursuing B.E. Information Technology with Specialization in Data Science, due to which I'm very passionate about statistics. 

In the current turmoil state and ongoing chaos in politics with propaganda and manipulative media, I wanted to give a vision to people through statistics and data where people can build their view and understand not just with authors words but through actual ground figures. 

Believing in situations through which we evolve, I always try to be even-handed to deliver my state of the story.
